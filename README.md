# Hi ðŸ˜„

I'm RÃ©mi, I'm 29. I studied mathematics and have been developing fun stuff on the web as a hobby since I was 12.

## What I code with

VS Code, Git (obviously), Deno, Docker, ...

## What I make

I've mostly been creating random stuff that comes to my mind as I'm trying to fall asleep. If you take a look at my repositories, you'll see a library to manipulate and convert colors, a progressive web app that displays minimalistic and procedurally generated planetary systems, a small arcade game developed for a game jam... and various other things.

Take a look around âœ¨
